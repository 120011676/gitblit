## Frequently Asked Questions

### Git:Blit?  What kind of name is that?
Its a phonetic play on [bitblt][bitblt] which is an image processing operation meaning *bit-block transfer*.

### Why use Git:Blit?
Its small.  Its portable.  Its easy to manage.

### Do I need real Git?
No.  Git:Blit is based on [JGit][jgit] which is a pure Java implementation of the [Git version control system][git].<br/>
Everything you need for Git:Blit is either in the zip distribution file or automatically downloaded on execution. 

### Why doesn't Git:Blit support SSH?
Git:Blit could integrate [Apache Mina](http://mina.apache.org) to provide SSH access.  However, doing so violates design principle #1: KISS.  SSH supports requires creating, exchanging, and managing SSH keys.  While this is doable, its not simple like JGit's SmartHTTP implementation.

You might consider [Gerrit](http://gerrit.googlecode.org) which supports SSH.

### What types of Search does Git:Blit support?
Git:Blit supports case-insensitive searches of *commit message* (default), *author*, and *committer*.<br/>

To search by *author* or *committer* use the following syntax in the search box:

    author: james
    committer: james
    
Alternatively, you could enable the search type dropdown list in your `gitblit.properties` file.

### How do I run Git:Blit on port 80 or 443 in Linux?
Tricky.  Linux requires root permissions to serve on ports < 1024.<br/>
Run the server as *root* (security concern) or change the ports you are serving to 8080 (http) or 8443 (https).

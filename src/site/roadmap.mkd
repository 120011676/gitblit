## Roadmap

This is not exactly a formal roadmap but it is a priority list of what might be implemented in future releases.  
This list is volatile and may not reflect what will be in the next release.

* **In-Progress**: Integrate an SSH daemon to complete the transport trifecta: http/https, git, and ssh (issue-369)
* Diff should highlight inserted/removed fragment compared to original line
* Respect Gerrit branch permissions, if found (issue 36)
